How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  -I focus on testing and validation at every stage of the development process to make sure my program is operating properly. I write automated unit tests using JUnit testing to make sure each element and method works as intended. This enables me to do regression testing to ensure that code changes don't interfere with already-existing functionality and to find flaws early. I adhere to best practices for security, such as the concept of least privilege, safe data processing, and input validation. In order to identify such hazards, I also employ static code analysis tools and test for vulnerabilities. As the project progresses, continuous integration solutions assist in automating tests and preserving security and functionality.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?
